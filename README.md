## Scripts in case you would like download it

In the project directory, you can run: <br />
### `npm start`<br />
### `npm test`<br />
### `npm run build`<br />
### `npm run eject`<br />

To run it on you machine you will have to create a **firebase** project and a **unsplah** project then add the projects credentials to your `.env`.
