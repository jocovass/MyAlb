It is a ReactJs application created with the `create-react-app` command.

The user can search for any pictures, for this I've used the `unspalsh API`. They also can save their favorites if they've registerd via `Facbook auth` or by using their `email`.

To run it on you machine you will have to create a **firebase** project and an **unsplah** project then add the projects credentials to your `.env`.
