## Scripts in case you would like download it

In the project directory, you can run:
`### npm start
 ### npm test
 ### npm run build
 ### npm run eject`

To run it on you machine you will have to create a **firebase** project and a **unsplah** project then add the projects credentials to your `.env`.

### Any feedback is appreciated.
